### Getting Started

You'll want to clone the repository and build the language on your system.

### FAQ

Is this named after Morpheus in **The Matrix**?

_Yes._

What are the next features to be implemented?

_Ideally some of the matrix operations like what I'm currently able to run using **matplotlib** and **numpy** in Python._

How do I compile the REPL?

__Something like the following
  ```cc -std=c99 -Wall prompt.c -ledit -o prompt
  ```
